# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Abigail DeVries, a designer, artist, and developer. Art and design are a strong passion of mine, going back to when I was a child. I specialize in graphic design, but I also do web design and development as well. Coding is enjoyable and exciting, as I am learning the visual and technical aspects of web design. As an artist, drawing is my favorite medium, but I also do charcoal. I want to remember to do pastel drawing and painting as well.

## What's new with me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning about web design and graphic design
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about web development. I am planning to learn more about CSS and start Javascript, too;
- ðŸŽ¨ Hobbies: sewing, fashion design, making things with my Cricut, knitting, and reading
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with what to do pursuing my education further and how to gain experience
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: If you want me to do a project for you, email me at ahdevries3@outlook.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: Currently, I am reading the Neptune Project by Polly Holyoke 10/10. I recommend it!
