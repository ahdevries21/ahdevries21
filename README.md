# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## Bio

My name is Abigail DeVries, a designer, artist, and developer. Art and design are a strong passion of mine, going back to when I was a child. I specialize in graphic design, but I also do web design and development as well. Coding is enjoyable and exciting, as I am learning the visual and technical aspects of web design. As an artist, drawing is my favorite medium, but I also do charcoal. I want to remember to do pastel drawing and painting as well.
